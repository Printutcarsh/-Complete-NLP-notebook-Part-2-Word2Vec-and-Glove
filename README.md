A tutorial on Word2Vec and Glove.
<hr>
This is the 2nd part of the complete NLP tutorial. Previously, I have talked about the basic concepts and approaches to do any NLP problem. Now here I have provided the remaining part of the tutorial and again I will be using spam message dataset from Kaggle in which we have to detect whether the message is spam or not. But if you are a beginner to NLP or want to know some different approaches for NLP problems, I would refer you read my previous notebook first and then read this kernel:- <a href = "https://github.com/Printutcarsh/Complete-NLP-notebook--spam-message-classifier">CLick here</a>
